<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>The app is a standalone herb reference book that provides plenty of information about nutrition value, health benefits, warnings and food  suggestion of different types of plant to users. Besides that, there is area for users to add notes, update and delete their notes for future reference.</p>
<p> To enrich more user interaction and experience with the app, we added custom built camera with the help Android's Camera X Api, and created a specialised gallery for storing plant's images. The purpose of having camera and gallery is for those who would like to capture every images of plant they find interested in on their ways and collect those images in the collection for keepsake. </p>
